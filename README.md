Covid-19 Data Exploration:

This project consists of an exploratory analysis of Covid-19 vaccination, reported cases and death data up until March 2021. Fields are derived such as the mortality and infection rates and how they relate to population, vaccination, and country categories. Techniques utilized include querying, aggregations, joins, CTEs, and Temp Tables. The findings in this project are imported to Tableau to create visualizations tracking overall death toll and countries most impacted from the virus.
